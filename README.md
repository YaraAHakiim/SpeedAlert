# SpeedAlert
A Library for monitoring the movement speed using speed and plays an alert when exceeding the set speed.

## Getting Started

Step 1: Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency:

```
dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.YaraAHakiim:SpeedAlert:1.0.2'
	}
```


### Usage


```
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    //Location permission request code
    private static final int REQUEST_LOCATION_PERMISSION_CODE = 101;

    //Declaring speed alert object to start tracking movement speed and play alerts
    private SpeedAlert mSpeedAlert;


    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        //Instantiating speed alert with context and max speed.
        mSpeedAlert = new SpeedAlert(this, 10);

        /*Setting alert mode and file, if not set a default alert will be played*/

        //Setting alert mode to play from local file
        mSpeedAlert.setAlertMode(AlertPlayer.Mode.DataFromLocalFile);
        //Setting file resource
        mSpeedAlert.setAlertResource(R.raw.alert);

        //Setting alert mode to play from a url
        //mSpeedAlert.setAlertMode(AlertPlayer.Mode.DataFromUrl);
        //Setting url of the file
        //mSpeedAlert.setAlertUrl("http://www.freesfx.co.uk/rx2/mp3s/5/16927_1461333031.mp3");

        /*Speed alert is based on GPS, so the location permission must be added to manifest and requested at runtime*/

        //Checking if location permission is granted
        if(ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            //Start tracking movement speed by giving location & speed minimum update time and distance. (time is seconds, distance in meters)
            mSpeedAlert.startTracking(1, 1);
        } else {
            //If location permission is not granted request it.
            ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[] {Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION},REQUEST_LOCATION_PERMISSION_CODE);
        }
    }

    //Called when user respond to requesting permissions.
    @Override
    public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, @NonNull String[] permissions, @NonNull int[] grantResults) {

        //If location permission is granted start tracking.
        if(requestCode == REQUEST_LOCATION_PERMISSION_CODE) {
            if(grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
                //Start tracking movement speed by giving location & speed minimum update time and distance. (time is seconds, distance in meters)
                mSpeedAlert.startTracking(1, 1);
            } else {
                Toast.makeText(this, "Location permission required", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        }
    }
  }
```
